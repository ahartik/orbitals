- Axis lines (X, Y, Z) with Bohr radius markers
- Correct scaling for real orbitals
- Analytical normals
- Benchmark
- Optimize MORE
  - Textures for r-func, theta-func and phi-func
    -> Can avoid shader generation completely!
    -x phi-func is hard to do for "real orbitals"
  - Compute bounding sphere for the orbital based on R-function
    -> Compute ray intersection with this sphere and divide into N parts
    ->
  - Mobile performance
  - Render to texture to render low res first:
    - Upscale 4x -> 2x -> 1x
    - Faster panning and zooming
    - Allows higher res raymarching for less visual glitches
    - Useful for future projects too.
    - Maybe get good enough mobile perf?
- Mobile UI
- Negative M
- Complex coloring
  - Prettier gradient
  - legend
